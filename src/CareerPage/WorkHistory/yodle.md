At Yodle I transitioned to working on SaaS / web applications and took on a managerial / leadership role. I went from a line level manager to senior leadership and ended up running the “LeadStream” teams, responsible for SEO and SEM, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in daily ad spend, for Yodle’s 50,000 customers. I had as many as 5 teams or 30 engineers reporting through me.
Yodle was a big turning point for me professionally and technically.
Yodle was the first time I was on a leadership / management track and it was a whole new technology stack.
Technically I learned a ton about how to build reliable web / SaaS applications at scale.Teams I led or managed were responsible for, among other things:
Managing websites for 30,000 customers
Building machine learning models that controlled hundreds of thousands of dollars in daily ad spend.
Syncing thousands of ad campaigns, millions of keywords, and tens of millions of negative keywords to Google and Bing. 
However, the most important lessons I learned at Yodle were about management and product development.
I was very lucky to join an organization that took leadership and management seriously. I had a series of great managers that gave me the tools to be successful not only as a line manager but as an organizational leader.
Yodle had a practice, which I don’t 100% agree with, of hiring for / giving people the responsibility for positions but that did mean I was hired with the aim of taking over as manager for my team.
From day 1 at Yodle I was learning how to do professional development, manage performance, and hire and build teams.
Yodle was a great experience to go from a line manager to director role running an organization of 4-5 teams with up to 30 engineers being responsible for hiring decisions, managing promotion and compensation strategy, and owning company-wide goals, e.g. managing improvements of hiring practices.
When Daniel Rolnick took over as CTO, he, Richard Buckman, and Gijo Mathew led a company-wide effort to rehabilitate how product development worked at Yodle.
That was the seed of my passion for modern, customer focused, data driven product practices.
