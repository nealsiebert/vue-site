To briefly touch on my early career. My roles at DoubleHelix and TerraGo were individual contributor roles focused mostly on 3D graphics, AAA game, and geospatial technologies.
On Front Mission, my last shipped title, I was the programming lead on all of the combat systems.
At TerraGo my first project was I turned LIDAR data and textures into geolocated 3D models as part of their suite of PDF mapping tools.
