I am an engineering and product leader with a passion for building world class product development teams. I believe that a strong company culture, modern product principles, and an effective engineering organization are critical to building great software companies. I have spent the last ten years of my career writing code, leading organizations, and building product strategies that solve problems for customers. I have improved large and complicated systems responsible for millions of dollars of digital ad spend and architected new systems to take software from prototype to scalable production grade systems. I have managed traditional software engineering, professional services, and data science teams in on-site, hybrid, and fully remote environments. With a history of success in the gaming, geospatial, digital advertising, and moving industries I am ready for my next challenge.
