My time at TerraGo, a small geospatial technology company, was brief but impactful. The team was made up of a mix of experts in GIS systems and PDFs, many of whom had military backgrounds which was important because TerraGoâ€™s biggest customer was the US Army. I learned a ton about GIS systems and PDFs (surprisingly complex). I architected and built a mobile PDF renderer using OpenGL and worked with an external partner to build a process to generate 3D geospatial models from LIDAR data and images, then embed them in a PDF.
