I love making things. Before college I spent a couple of years as a cabinet maker, my favorite part of that job were the install days. When we would take all the cabinets from the shop to the site and put them all up. Seeing rooms transformed from a blank box to a kitchen or a library was incredibly satisfying.

That act, creating something that people will use, is at the heart of what I love about software engineering. As engineers it is our job to solve real world problems; to make the impossible possible; to make people’s lives better. Engineers drive innovation by continuously adapting to emerging technologies and applying technologies in novel ways.

Engineering is an ongoing exercise in continuous education. It requires that we are better tomorrow than we are today. To be successful engineers, teams, and organizations must embrace continuous improvement, be curious and open minded, constantly seek the best solution, and embrace change, 

Engineering is a team sport. The myth of the “10x programmer” is long dead. Great software is built by teams of engineers working on shared goals. Engineers must coordinate and collaborate effectively with each other and with other departments to ensure their solutions are at a high level of quality and have the desired impact.
