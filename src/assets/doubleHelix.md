I always wanted to make games, getting to do it for a living was a lot of fun. It is one of the most collaborative roles you can have as a software developer, 100 people all trying to pull in the same direction to make something cool. I worked with 3D artists, animators, fx artists, level designers, and the list goes on. If you want to learn the value of teamwork, games is a great place to start.
