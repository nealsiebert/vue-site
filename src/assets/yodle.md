Yodle/Web.com was focused on helping small businesses build their online presence and optimize their digital advertising.  Often described as a "CMO in a box," Yodle/Web.com's products helped small businesses build and maintain SEO-optimized websites, collect reviews, and manage their social media, email marketing, and paid ad budgets.\

I left Yodle/Web.com as a Senior Software Engineer and left as a Director of Engineering. I was responsible for the product and technology strategy, LeadStream. My organization (department?) included Engineering and Data Science teams who handled building websites, SEO, and digital advertising for 50,000+ small businesses across 250 industries.\

At Yodle/Web.com, I was very lucky to have a series of managers who taught me the value of servant leadership and good product management practices. The most effective teams embraced these practices at Yodle/Web.com, and this experience allowed me to excel as a manager and lead effective teams.
