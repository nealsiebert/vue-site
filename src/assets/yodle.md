Yodle/Web.com was focused on helping small businesses build their online presence and optimize their digital advertising. Often described as a "CMO in a box," Yodle/Web.com's products helped small businesses build and maintain SEO-optimized websites, collect reviews, and manage their social media, email marketing, and paid ad budgets.\

I was very lucky to have a series of managers who pushed me out of my comfort zone and  taught me the value of servant leadership and product management. I left Yodle/Web.com as a Director of Engineering. I was responsible for the product and technology strategy for LeadStream. My department included Engineering and Data Science teams who built websites, optimized SEO, and managed digital advertising for 50,000+ small businesses across 250 industries.
