I want to talk about coaching. It's not going to surprise anyone that know me that I am a little socially awkward. I can get serious about a topic, e.g. coaching and management, when it is probably not totally appropriate. I have had a couple of those conversations recently, and before their eyes glaze over people always say something like "I just don't understand why they wouldn't [INSERT REASONABLE EXPECTATION HERE]". 

One of the hardest and most critical things a manager does is communicate expectations and set goals. It's not easy. This blog post isn't going to make you a good manager. Although, [First, Break All the Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First,_Break_All_the_Rules) is great place to start.
