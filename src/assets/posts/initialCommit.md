Oh, you’re starting a blog, cool, cool cool cool, no doubt no doubt. But why, does the world really need to hear what you have to say? There are so many engineers out there blogging, do we really need [YAEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_another)? Yes, obviously. Really, why? I'm glad you asked. For the past 6 years I was the Head of Engineering for a very small bootstrap startup. That was a, very, resource constrained environment, it gave me a different perspective on the practical application of product, engineering, and leadership best practices. Many of the same trade-offs still exist, but they are magnified. I think that is worth sharing. Also, people don't use enough links in their blogs. I'll make sure you get a few good [Wikipedia rabbit holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole).\

Ok, fine ... that’s not terrible, but how are you going to do it? As engineers part of our job is staying up to date on best practices, new technology, etc. For me, that involves a decent amount of reading and listening. I have found a ton of content on specific topics, how to get started with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), or [INSERT TECHNOLOGY HERE]. There is great content on abstract leadership and product topics, if you're not following [SVPG](https://www.svpg.com/) you should be. What I think is missing is long form serial content, a story about how a product is built. And, that makes sense. Most product managers and engineers aren't spending their time writing blogs, then need to, you know, do their jobs. That's where I come in. I have plans for two series to start:

1. **Startup Life:** A retrospective on my time at a bootstrap startup. What I learned about building software on the cheap with a small team, integrating product management practices into the company culture, and generally what was it like to work in a company that maxed out at 18 people.
2. **Help my dog:** My dog, Bear, has home alone distress ([separation anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_in_dogs)). Helping him get over it means working with a trainer who specializes in [behavior modification](https://avsab.org/). This is a complex process that requires data capture by the dog's guardian and analysis by the trainer. While there are a number of dog training apps available today, none that are fit for this purpose. I want to find out if there is a real opportunity to build something useful.

There will, of course, be the more standard fare. I am working on a post about how I built a [website](/blog/I%20need%20a%20website) using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to host this blog and another post, inspired by [Marty Cagen's](https://www.svpg.com/team/marty-cagan/) excellent [article](https://www.svpg.com/coaching-tools-the-assessment/) on assessing product managers, on a framework for [evaluating engineers](/blog/Engineer%20Evaluations). If any of that interests to you, I hope will consider following. I will have medium links and an RSS feed coming soon, or just follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealsiebert/)
