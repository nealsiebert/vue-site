Leadership and management practices have changed dramatically in the past twenty years. We now know that outcome based management techniques, servant leadership, and empowered autonomous teams improves both the company performance and employee engagement. In other words, it's better for business and makes people happier if you trust your teams to work towards a shared goal.

The switch from the old command and control methods to servant leadership affects every level of an organization. I have been very lucky in my career and had the opportunity to work with, and learn from, many strong leaders. To see first hand the positive impact a culture built on trust, accountability, mutual respect, and continuous improvement can have on customers and employees.

There are many different leadership styles, but all great leaders consciously model desirable behaviors. They are: able to promote constructive conflict and maintain a high degree of alignment, comfortable with ambiguity and have a bias for action, personally responsible for their failures and actively promote the accomplishments of others.
