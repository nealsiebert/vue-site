Hi, I am Neal B. Siebert a software engineering and product development leader. I am passionate about modern product development, emerging technologies, best practices in software development, and modern management techniques. I believe that anyone who aspires to be a leader in the software industry, especially those who practice servant leadership, should be doing what they can to educate and coach in those areas. This site is a place that I will be exploring all those areas and sharing what I learn.
