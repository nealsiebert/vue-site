    I am passionate about product development, emerging technologies, best practices in software development, and modern management techniques. If any of those interest you I write about them over <router-link to="/blog">

    When I am not siting in a dark room typing furiously while staring at a monochrome green monitor I can be found, chasing a Bear around a park, getting eaten alive by mosquitos, or hurling frisbees at trees.
